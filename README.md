Assignment Breif:

WE 3.0 HTML Assignment
Based on the BootStrap and jQuery that you have learned in this course, develop a web site prototype from a complex web app. Your application should have the following features:

1. A website with a number of pages (eg. 4 to 10). Your submission should include a zipped website containing a selection of html pages and a sensible folder structure. You can choose to base this structure on the Bootstrap downloadable templates or build it yourself from scratch. Each page should contain a relevant doctype, be well commented, well formatted and free from javascipt errors. Your comments need not be exhaustive but should describe what each of the main sections in the pages do and approximately how they work.

2. Based on Bootstrap and jQuery. Your site should contain and use the appropriate bootstrap css and js. i.e. sites intended for mobile use should be fully responsive.

3. A consistent navigation system (eg nav bar). The user should never feel lost or unable to find their way to any of the main sections of your site, regardless of where they enter the site or navigate to.

4. Include a selection of Bootstrap components. See http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/components.html

5. Include a transition effect (or some other animated jQuery effect). See http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html
You should include some animated transition effect(s) on each page of your site. CSS hover effects are not sufficient â€“ aim for some Bootstrap / jQuery here.

6. Include your own CSS and use some of your own classes and id's. At least some elements on your site should include your own styling. Use best practices when deciding where to include these.

7. Communicate with at least one Bootstrap plugin using Data Attributes i.e. data-toggle / data-target

8. Use best practices when thinking about how your pages load i.e. JS, etc.
